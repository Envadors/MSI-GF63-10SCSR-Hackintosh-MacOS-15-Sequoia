‚ö†Ô∏è You do not need to modify the EFI to get it to run! However if you also want to get icloud running you will need to
generate a simbios for it which I listed the steps in  the bottom ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚ù§Ô∏è Credits to Forte500 on Reddit for providing the original EFI configuration compatible with both Ventura and Monterey, which I then modified and optimized for Sonoma. The Sequoia EFI, however, was developed entirely by me from the ground up, with no external sources or pre-existing configurations used. ‚ù§Ô∏è



## üõ† UEFI - Bios Settings
<details>
<summary><strong>UEFI Custom Hackintosh Settingse</strong></summary>
